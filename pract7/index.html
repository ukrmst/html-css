    <h1>Title: “The Quiet Window”</h1>
    <p id = "first">
        Every morning, just before the sun rises, a warm stripe of light falls through the window above the kitchen sink. It’s not special in the way sunsets are — no pink clouds, no dramatic colors — but it feels like a quiet promise.
        
        That light always lands on the same chipped ceramic mug, the one with a fading blue pattern and a crack near the handle. No one ever throws it out. It holds the morning’s first coffee and, somehow, the memory of every morning before.
        
        Outside, the world stirs slowly: a few birds, a shifting breeze, a bicycle wheel spinning down the street. Inside, the kettle whistles, and for a moment, there’s only steam and silence. Then the day begins.

    <h2>Subtitle: “The Unseen Symphony”</h2>
    <p id = "second">
        In the heart of the city, where the noise never sleeps, there exists a symphony that goes unnoticed. It’s not composed of instruments or voices but of the everyday sounds that weave through life: the rustle of leaves, the distant laughter of children, the soft hum of a refrigerator.
        
        Each sound is a note, each moment a measure. Together, they create a melody that plays in the background, often ignored but always present. It’s a reminder that beauty can be found in the mundane, if only we take a moment to listen.
    </p>

    <h3>Subtitle: “The Forgotten Garden”</h3>
    <p id = "third">
        Tucked away behind a high stone wall, there lies a garden that time forgot. Once vibrant with flowers and laughter, it now stands still, overgrown and silent. The air is thick with the scent of wildflowers and the whispers of memories long past.
        
        Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground. A single butterfly flits from flower to flower, as if searching for something lost. In this forgotten place, nature reclaims its own, reminding us that even in neglect, there is beauty.
